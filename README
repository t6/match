A small tool for renaming/copying/linking files

Usage: match -p pattern -f format [-a action] [-iq] file ...

-a
        `action` can be any command with source-target arguments like cp(1),
        mv(1) or ln(1).  If not specified match runs in  dry run mode and will
        not change anything.

-p
        The pattern files are matched against.  `action` is only executed on a file
        when there is a match.

-f
        The target filename.  %n will be replaced by the n-th capture from the pattern.

-i
        Ignore errors from executing `action`.

-q
        Don't output anything

Example:

Rename all files like '123 - foo.jpg' to 'foo.jpg' in the current directory:

    $ match -p '%d+% %-% ([%a%p]+)' -f '%1' *

The pattern language is described in patterns(7):
