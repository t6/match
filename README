A small tool for renaming/copying/linking files

Usage: match -p pattern [-t format] [-a action] [-iq] file ...

-a
        `action` can be any command with source-target arguments like cp(1),
        mv(1) or ln(1).  Defaults to echo(1).

-p
        The pattern files are matched against.  `action` is only executed on a file
        when there is a match.

-t
        The target filename.  %n will be replaced by the n-th capture from the
        pattern.  Defaults to %0.

-m
        Don't pass the target filename to action.  Useful if you just want to
        see which file matches the given pattern.

-i
        Ignore errors from executing `action`.

-v
        Warn on non-matches.

Example:

Rename all files like '123 - foo.jpg' to 'foo.jpg' in the current directory:

    $ match -p '%d+% %-% ([%a%p]+)' -f '%1' *

The pattern language is described in patterns(7):
